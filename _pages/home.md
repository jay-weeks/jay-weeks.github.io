I work at the intersection of agricultural science, sustainability, and modeling to build environmentally sound, profitable agricultural systems and businesses. And while data and models are certainly important, I believe that long-lasting impact can only be achieved when we truly understand and properly align incentive structures (social and financial) behind market-based solutions.
