I have been fortunate to work on a variety of projects aimed at improving the sustainability and profitability of agricultural systems. Please click on the project titles below for more details.

Modeling greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural fields provides an opportunity to optimize low emissions supply chains and identify regions in which invention programs that promote soil health and improved fertilizer use efficiency may be most effective.

        Source and formulation matter: <br> New insights into phosphorus fertilizer fate and transport in mildly calcareous soils

Using wet chemical and synchrotron-based techniques, this research demonstrated that phosphorus fertilizer source (i.e., ortho- vs. polyphosphate) likely plays a greater role in determining fertilizer use efficiency in P-fixing soils than the industry currently recognizes providing opportunities for new and/or improved products in the future.
