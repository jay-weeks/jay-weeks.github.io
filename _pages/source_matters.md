<h1 align="center"> Source and formulation matter: <br> New insights into phosphorus fertilizer fate and transport in <br> mildly calcareous soils </h1>

## TL;DR
Generally, farmers select phosphorus fertilizers based on price and application method of choice, because the source itself is thought to not impact crop availability. Prior research has demonstrated that on highly calcareous soils (high pH and calcium carbonate concentration), liquid fertilizers perform better than their granular counterparts. This study, investigating the chemical fate of different liquid fertilizer formulations, suggests that source may influence how P partitions in soil, and thus plant availability, more than previously thought. Combining polyphosphates and orthophosphates, applying more dilute formulations, and/or using certain co-applicants may improve nutrient use efficiency in these historically challenging soils allowing growers to potentially save on fertilizer costs and mitigate soil P loading that can contribute to freshwater pollution. 

## Technical Abstract 
Phosphorus fertilizer use efficiency can be poor in calcareous soils as a result of calcium phosphate precipitation reactions. To avoid crop P deficiency, growers may apply more fertilizer than is agronomically necessary, creating a surplus of P in soil that can erode or leach into nearby waterbodies and promote eutrophication. This study investigated the effects of liquid P fertilizer source, application volume, and co-application of a gelling agent on P partitioning in two mildly calcareous soils from Kansas. Treatments included phosphoric acid, monoammonium phosphate (MAP), diammonium phosphate, ammonium polyphosphate (APP), and an 80% MAP/20% APP mixture applied at one total P rate over two concentrations or co-applied with sodium alginate (AG). Soils were incubated for 4 wk in Petri dishes and then sectioned in concentric rings from the point of application. Anion exchange resin (AER) extractability assessed plant availability and total P determination evaluated diffusion. Sequential extraction and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy were implemented to probe reaction products and pathways. Incorporation of polyphosphates, co-application of AG, and dilution with water improved the proportion of P that was AER extractable in the case of monoammonium phosphate from ∼36 to 66, 58, and 65%, respectively. Increased plant availability may be accomplished through a combination of at least two mechanisms: retarded ripening of calcium phosphate minerals into sparingly soluble forms and altered partitioning of P to soil colloids. Understanding the conditions under which these concepts scale to the field could result in increased farm profitability and nutrient use efficiency.

## Methods Overview
This project was a laboratory incubation study in which two mildly calcareous soils, 1 and 2, from western Kansas were packed into Petri dishes at a bulk density of 1.1g/cm^3 and equilibrated to 50% maximum water holding capacity. Liquid fertilizer treatments of 9.2 mg P, the approximate amount of P in a MAP granule, were applied to the center of the dish in one of two volumes of water; 125µL or 625 µL.

After a 28 day incubation period, the soil from the dishes was excavated in concentric rings (radii in mm) surrounding the fertilizer point of application, dried, and ground for analysis.

### Analysis
Each sample ring was then analyzed for the following parameters:
- pH
- Total P 
- Resin Extractable Orthophosphate - "Plant Available P" 
- Resin Extractable "Other P" 
    - Note: "Other P" = Polyphosphates
- Sequential P Fractionation 
- Synchrotron-based X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy

## Results Highlights
While a wide variety treatments were tested in this project, a subset of the most relevant results are disucssed here. Please see the cited article and/or reach out to me for additional details. 

### Total P Diffusion
For all treatments, the vast majority of P stayed within 8mm of the point of application. Greater diffusion was observed in diluted applications and those containing polyphosphates. Greater diffusion increases the zone of P enrichment that can be accessed by plant roots. Additonally, when the same amount of P occupies a larger volume of soil, the likelihood of precipitation reactions that reduce plant availability over time are lowered.

### Resin Extractable "Plant Available" P

Looking at the center, point of application (0-8mm) section results where the majority of the applied P remained, the overall anion exchange resin performance can be summarized as:

80/20 = APP = MAP 625 > PA = MAP + AG > MAP 125 > DAP

Anion exchange resin extractability correlates well with the fraction of P that is extractable by plants in the field.

At first glance, it appears that APP does not perform as well as treatments like 80/20 or MAP + Alginate. However, once the remaining, yet to be hydrolyzed, polyphosphates are accounted for ("Other P"), the performace is comparable. In the field, polyphosphates are thought to hyrolyze into orthophosphates, the form used by plants, relatively quickly. Here, that was not necessarily the case and thus remains an open question to be explored in the future. 

<h4 align="center"> Orthophosphate (PO4) + Other P (Polyphosphates) </h4>

The above observations suggests that, relative to traditional MAP and DAP fertilizers, P lability may be improved in calcareous soil through one of three ways:
1. Including polyphosphates in orthophosphate fertilizers <br> (APP and 80/20 treatments)
2. Applying more dilute, acidic orthophosphate formulations (MAP 625)
3. Co-applying fertilizers with products like sodium alginate

<h2 align="center"> Why are some formulations more plant available than others? </h2>

To get a better understanding of what may be happening to the treatments when they are applied to the soil, a sequential P fraction procedure and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy were used. 

### Sequential P Fractionation

The sequential fractionation procedure was completed in five steps to identify five different "pools" of P in calcareous soils:
1. Dicalcium Phosphate (Highly soluble calcium phosphate - more plant available)
2. Octacalcium Phosphate (Less soluble calcium phosphate - less plant available)
3. Aluminum Associated P (Potentially plant available)
4. Iron Associated P (Potentially plant available)
5. Highly Insoluble Phosphate Minerals (Generally not plant available)

The most striking result of this procedure was the significant divergence in partitioning between the orthophosphate-only treatments and those containing polyphosphates (80/20 and APP). Not only is the step 1 extractable P substantially lower in the polyphosphate treatments, but the iron and aluminum associated fractions are enriched relative to the orthophosphates as well.

        </kbd>
    </a>
</p>

Regressing the step 1 extactable P against the proportion of P that was resin extractable (plant available), there is remarkable correlation between the two for the orthophosphate treatments and much less for the polyphosphates suggesting that plant available P is partitioning to and being supplied from different pools depending on the P fertilizer source.

### Synchrotron-Based X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy

Chemical speciation analysis of the center section soils via X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES) further confirms this divergence in partitioning. Comparing the spectra of samples, we can visually see substantial differences in spectral shape.

</p>

For example, contrasting 2-PA 125 versus 2-APP 125, samples with roughly similar plant available P, the presence of a post-edge shoulder (~2154 eV) in the 2-PA 125 sample is unmistakable relative to its absence in the 2-APP 125 treatment. That shoulder is associated with the presence of calcium phosphate minerals as can be seen in the apatite standard below, whereas the absence is typically indicative of more sorbed P species observed in the ferrihydrite adsorbed P standard.

</p>

Recreation of the treatment spectra using known standards via an analysis technique known as linear combination fitting (LCF), allows us to approximate the proportion of each P pool in each sample. The results in the table below are consistent with the findings of the sequential P fraction: orthophosphates tended to form more calcium phosphate minerals and the presence of polyphosphates shifted a portion of the added P to sorbed forms (comparable to steps 3 & 4 of the sequential extraction).

## Implications for Innovation

It is true that today when liquid phosphorus fertilizer is applied, it is in the form of APP which is approximately 50/50 orthophosphate/polyphosphate.
