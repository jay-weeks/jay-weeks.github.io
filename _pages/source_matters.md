<h1 align="center"> Source and formulation matter: <br> New insights into phosphorus fertilizer fate and transport in mildly calcareous soils </h1>

## Abstract 
Phosphorus fertilizer use efficiency can be poor in calcareous soils as a result of calcium phosphate precipitation reactions. To avoid crop P deficiency, growers may apply more fertilizer than is agronomically necessary, creating a surplus of P in soil that can erode or leach into nearby waterbodies and promote eutrophication. This study investigated the effects of liquid P fertilizer source, application volume, and co-application of a gelling agent on P partitioning in two mildly calcareous soils from Kansas. Treatments included phosphoric acid, monoammonium phosphate (MAP), diammonium phosphate, ammonium polyphosphate (APP), and an 80% MAP/20% APP mixture applied at one total P rate over two concentrations or co-applied with sodium alginate (AG). Soils were incubated for 4 wk in Petri dishes and then sectioned in concentric rings from the point of application. Anion exchange resin (AER) extractability assessed plant availability and total P determination evaluated diffusion. Sequential extraction and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy were implemented to probe reaction products and pathways. Incorporation of polyphosphates, co-application of AG, and dilution with water improved the proportion of P that was AER extractable in the case of monoammonium phosphate from ∼36 to 66, 58, and 65%, respectively. Increased plant availability may be accomplished through a combination of at least two mechanisms: retarded ripening of calcium phosphate minerals into sparingly soluble forms and altered partitioning of P to soil colloids. Understanding the conditions under which these concepts scale to the field could result in increased farm profitability and nutrient use efficiency.

## Methods Overview
This project was a laboratory incubation study in which two mildly calcareous soils, 1 and 2, from western Kansas were packed into Petri dishes at a bulk density of 1.1g/cm^3 and equilibrated to 50% maximum water holding capacity. Liquid fertilizer treatments of 9.2 mg P, the approximate amount of P in a MAP granule, were applied to the center of the dish in one of two volumes of water; 125µL or 625 µL.

|APP                    | 125µL (16.9% P₂O₅) | Sodium Alginate (AG) – 1.25mg |
|DAP                    | 625µL (3.4% P₂O₅)  |                               |

After a 28 day incubation period, the soil from the dishes was excavated in concentric rings (radii in mm) surrounding the fertilizer point of application, dried, and ground for analysis.

### Analysis
Each sample ring was then analyzed for the following parameters:
- **pH** – 1:10 soil:water
- **Total P** (Aqua Regia Digestion - Premarathna et al., 2010) 
    - ICP-OES analysis
- **Resin Extractable Orthophosphate - "Plant Available P"** (Khatiwada et al., 2012)
    - Spectrophotometer Analysis (Molybdenum Blue Method - Murphy & Riley, 1962)
- **Resin Extractable "Other P"** (McBeath, Smernik, Lombi, & McLaughlin, 2006)
    - Spectrophotometer Analysis (Molybdenum Blue Method - Murphy & Riley, 1962)
    - Note: "Other P" mainly pertains to yet to be hydrolyzed polyphosphates
- **Sequential P Fractionation** (Baifan and Yichu, 1989)
    - ICP-OES analysis
- **Synchrotron-based X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XANES)**

## Highlights
While a wide variety treatments were tested in this project, a subset of the most relevant results are disucssed here. Please see the paper and/or reach out to me for additional details. 

### Total P Diffusion
For all treatments, the vast majority of P stayed within 8mm of the point of application. Greater diffusion was observed in diluted applications and those containing polyphosphates.

### Resin Extractable Orthophosphate - "Plant Available P"

Looking at the center, point of application (0-8mm) section results where the majority of the applied P remained, the overall plant availability performance can be summarized as:

80/20 = APP = MAP 625 > PA = MAP + AG > MAP > DAP

This data suggests that, relative to traditional MAP and DAP fertilizers, P lability may be improved in calcareous soil through one of three ways:
1. Including a small amount of polyphosphate with majority orthophosphate fertilizers (APP and 80/20 treatments)
2. Applying higher volumes of more dilute, acidic fertilizers (MAP 625)
3. Co-applying fertilizers with products like sodium alginate




 the orthophosphate (PO4) treatments MAP applied with alginate was as labile as the other top performers
