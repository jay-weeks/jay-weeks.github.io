# Podcast
January 15, 2019 - November 18, 2019 <br>
Founded and co-hosted the ["Something to Chew On"](https://kstate-gfs.libsyn.com/#) podcast as part of the Kansas State University Global Food Systems Initiative. 

*"Our lives are frequently and significantly affected by food. Because we must eat to survive, many human cultures have developed with food at their very core. The goal of this podcast is to explore the complexity and nuance of food systems, celebrate the progress we have made, and debate the best ways for humans to proceed forward into the future."*
